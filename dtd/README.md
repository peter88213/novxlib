# The novx document type definition

If you want to validate a *.novx* file, you can copy the latest DTD file
into your project directory.

**Note:** Since the *novelibre* application does not validate its project files, 
this DTD is not needed for your daily work. However, it can be useful developing
of third-party applications and tools that read or write *.novx* files.
